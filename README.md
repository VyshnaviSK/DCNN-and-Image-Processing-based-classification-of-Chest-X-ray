# DCNN-and-Image-Processing-based-classification-of-Chest-X-ray

The sudden and rapid spread of COVID-19 created turmoil for many individ- uals, nations, and the world. One of the many ways of restraining the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is to detect cases and isolate them as quickly as possible. The medical community is currently using multiple methods of diagnosis to aid in quicker detection of COVID-19. In light of the current scenario, we propose image preprocessing of the chest x-ray scans (CXR) for more automatic classification of CXR scans by a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) to help radiologists and doctors identify potential COVID-19 infected patients. The study uses a dataset con- sisting of 4265 CXR scans for training, including 473 CXR scans of COVID-19 patients, the others belong to the categories of healthy, pneumonia bacterial, and pneumonia viral CXR scans. We conduct an extensive investigation of various pre-trained models such as RESNET50, VGG16, Xception, MobileNet, and DenseNet201. The model DenseNet201 has exceptional performance with a training accuracy of 100% and a validation accuracy of 94.81%. We believe that our proposed model will help doctors and radiologists successfully and quickly identify COVID-19 patients and help contain the spread.
